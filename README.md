# DES Cryptosystem
*Cryptosystem DES*, implemented in Java.
To test the system, use [NIST Tests](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Random-Bit-Generation/Documentation-and-Software):
- FREQUENCY MONOBITS TEST
- BINARY MATRIX RANK TEST
- CUMULATIVE SUMS TEST
- FREQUENCY MONOBITS TEST
- LINEAR COMPLEXITY TEST
- LONGEST RUN OF ONES TEST
- MAURER'S UNIVERSAL STATISTICAL TEST
- RANDOM EXCURSION TEST
- RUNS TEST
- SERIAL TEST
 
The project requires a [commons-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi) package
